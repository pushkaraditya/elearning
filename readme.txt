The system targets creating basic LMS system which could at least provide following
1. List of upcoming course
2. Allow users to register
3. List of users registered for a course
4. Provide a feedback of the course
5. Can take suggestions for creating new courses

Here are the brief list of technologies I am going to use
1. C# 4.0  using VS 2010 (oppsss, at the moment my company allow only that)
2. Database tools
3. Angular
4. Dapper.Net
5. ASP.NET WebApi (which probably are not RSETful)
